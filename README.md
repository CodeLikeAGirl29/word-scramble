# Word Scramble

This project is a demonstration of my design and front-end development capabilities. It features a Word Scramble game built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Users are presented with a scrambled word and must guess the correct word by entering letters into the provided input fields. The game tracks the number of tries and mistakes, and users can reset or generate new words to play again. The design focuses on simplicity, responsiveness, and user-friendly interactivity.
